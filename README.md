# Cracking The Coding Interview
## Ruby Solutions
The problems in Cracking The Coding Interview are in Java, but I am interviewing in Ruby.
To help study I am translating the solutions from Java to Ruby.

The problem numbers are for the 6th edition of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's book
'Cracking the Coding Interview', which I highly recommend you purchase [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
