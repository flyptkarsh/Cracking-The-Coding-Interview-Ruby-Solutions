# Total area of two overlapping rectangles
# Given two overlapping rectangles on a plane.
# We are given bottom left and top right points of the two rectangles.
# We need to find the total area.

# Input : Point l1 = {2, 2}, r1 = {5, 7};
#         Point l2 = {3, 4}, r2 = {6, 9};
# Output : Total Area = 24
#
# Input :Point l1 = {2, 1}, r1 = {5, 5};
#        Point l2 = {3, 2}, r2 = {5, 7};
# Output : Total Area = 16
